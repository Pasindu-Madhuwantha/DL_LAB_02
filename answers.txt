there's a balance to be struck when deciding the number of hidden nodes in a neural network.Too 
few can lead to underfitting, while too many can lead to overfitting. The best number of hidden nodes
often depends on the complexity of the problem and the amount of available data. Cross-validation or 
other techniques can help in selecting an appropriate number of hidden nodes to achieve good generalization 
performance.
